# Fallout-Vault-Defense-Rewrite
Complete rewrite of Fallout Vault Defense.

**UPDATE**
**This project isn't being worked on and won't be until Scratch 3.0 is released! The upcoming 16:9 aspect support is required for the game to actually be fun, so I'm not working on this until then.**

If you download a build, please do not share it on Scratch. Use the offline editor to test the build and please report any bugs to me.
